An operating system is an abstraction of computer system hardware; it manages the sharing of various hardware and software resources among the users of the computer system. The parallel history of hardware and operating system development introduces many key concepts including, for example, processor modes, direct memory access (DMA), device controllers, and virtual memory. Basic approaches to kernel organization and implementation are considered. This is often the first course in which students encounter concurrency and concurrent programs. Additional topic areas include system performance evaluation (particularly relating to processor and memory management), security, virtualization, resource allocation and scheduling, and file systems.

|:---------|:------|
| 100% to 97% | A+	|
| <97% to 94%  | A 	|
| <94% to 90% | A-	|
| <90% to 87%  | B+	|
| <87% to 84%  | B 	|
| <84% to 80%  | B-	|
| <80% to 77%  | C+	|
| <77% to 74%  | C 	|
| <74% to 70%  | C-	|
| <70% to 67%  | D+	|
| <67% to 64%  | D 	|
| <64% to 60%  | D-	|
| <60% to 0%    | F 	|


## Late Policy
Homeworks and Programming Assignments are subject to late penalty. Here is the point deduction policy: <span style="color:red"> **20% deduction (late by 1 day), 40% deduction (late by 2 days), 80% deduction (late by 3 days), and no credit if late by more than three days.** </span>

Contact the instructor in case of a medical emergency, and a written proof from your doctor is required. <span style="color:red"> **You are allowed to extend one more day after the approval.** </span>
